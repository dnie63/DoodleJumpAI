## General info
This simple version of Doodle Jump includes everything but black holes, springs, jet packs, helicopter hats, and shooting. NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) is a genetic algorithm that builds up neural networks from scratch and only allows those who do the best in each generation to reproduce and mutate to form the next generation's neural networks.

## Setup
All you need is the latest version of Processing and to download the entire repo.

## Code Examples
Simply open up the project in the Processing application and click the "Run" button in the top left with the play sign.

## Features
List of features ready and TODOs for future development
* Can enable/disable monsters to see difference in learning
* Can tweak the evolution parameters to find a balance between mutation and consistency
* Can visually see what the neural network looks like for the highest player in a given generation

To-do list:
* Have players learn to avoid monsters
* Have players learn to teleport from one side of the screen to the other

## Status
Project is still in progress.

## Inspiration
This project was inspired by the YouTube channel Code Bullet.
